 
	**Creative Coding** - OpenFrameworks Dorkshop - Bootcamp 2015
	
	Sunday, August 16 from 4pm - 7pm 	 


## Description
This dorkshop is an introduction to the openFrameworks C++ toolkit! It is in many ways a helping hand for your CC Lab unit on openFrameworks. It will also give you more freedom to experiement with creative coding in your first few weeks of Marjor Studio I.

## Materials and Supplies
This dorkshop is about the [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) C++ toolkit and will use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) as the online platform to share code, research notes and papers. (Please read and follow the [setup](Setup.md) document BEFORE coming to class.)  

<!--You may find additional help and inspiration in the examples contained in the following repositories:

##### C++ and oF
Because we will code in C++, the sooner you get comfortable with it the better. There is A LOT of helpful extra material; personally I like the following resources:

* [ofBook](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/tree/master/chapters)

* [Stanford University - CS107 - Programming Paradigms](http://videolectures.net/stanfordcs107s08_programming_paradigms/) by Jerry Cain

* [Effective C++](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/0321334876/ref=sr_1_23?ie=UTF8&qid=1408141753&sr=8-23&keywords=c%2B%2B) by Scott Meyers

As regular consulting material you will probably want to have the following links pre-bookmarked on your browser:

* [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/) I encourage the use of [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) on MacOS

* [OpenFrameworks Forum](http://forum.openframeworks.cc/) 

* [OpenFrameworks IRC Channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openframeworks&uio=MT1mYWxzZSY5PXRydWUmMTE9Mjk39)

* StackOverFlow [C++](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b), [CodeBlocks](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/codeblocks) & [Xcode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xcode) (There is an openFrameworks tag, but is better if you use the OF-forum for questions.)

##### Resources
There are a huge number of papers, books and examples online about algorithms and simulation. Not all of them are in C++, but hopefully you will train yourself to interpret and translate them. Here are some friendly approaches:

* [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/) by Daniel Shiffman

* [FORM+CODE](http://www.amazon.com/Form-Code-Design-Architecture-Briefs/dp/1568989377/ref=pd_sim_b_5?ie=UTF8&refRID=1JSMXNRNDJXKC5N91R2J) by Casey Reas

* [Generative Design](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1616890770/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=2P8RIIKRMUEMF&coliid=I5PWJK09L1FVH) by Hartmut Bohnacker, Benedikt Gross, Julia Laub and Claudius Lazzeroni

* [The Computational Beauty of Nature](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262561271/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) by Gary William Flake ( [here](https://github.com/gwf/CBofN) are the code examples from the book)

* [The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf) by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer

* [Golanâ€™s](http://golancourses.net/2013/lectures/lecture-01-30/) class notes of Generative Art
