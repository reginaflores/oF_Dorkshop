Welcome to **Simulation Studio FALL 2014**, [here](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/sims2014) you will find the class material.

## Course Description
This studio course will focus on computer simulation algorithms. Students will practice different techniques to improve their ability to observe and think algorithmically. 

Think of this course as a regular drawing studio course. You will exercise and train your abilities by observing and sketching over and over. Different computational techniques and mathematical principles will be presented and it's up to you to gradually incorporate them into your sketches. This course will require you to practice at home. Expect to do a LOT of homework from week to week.

We will start by reviewing the basics of Object Oriented Programming. This will be the foundation of the computer paradigm we will use to code our simulations. We will also cover trigonometric principles to understand the foundations of physics simulations.

Then we will move towards more complex simulations using multiple forces (attraction, repulsion, bouncing, springs, field forces, noise, etc). We will see how collective patterns can emerge from individual behavior.

Several case studies inspired by nature (Flocking Systems, L-Systems, Gray Scott's Reaction-Diffusion, etc.) will be presented together with their computational implementation.

Students will complete field trips and collect observations of natural patterns and phenomena. They will present a midterm and final project, applying learned concepts to create computer programs. Both projects will include students' meticulous research on their natural references.

## Materials and Supplies
This dorkshop is about the [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) C++ toolkit and will use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) as the online platform to share code, research notes and papers. (Please read and follow the [setup](Setup.md) document BEFORE coming to class.)

##### C++ and oF
Because we will code in C++, the sooner you get comfortable with it the better. There is A LOT of helpful extra material; personally I like the following resources:

* [ofBook](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/tree/master/chapters)

* [Stanford University - CS107 - Programming Paradigms](http://videolectures.net/stanfordcs107s08_programming_paradigms/) by Jerry Cain

* [Effective C++](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/0321334876/ref=sr_1_23?ie=UTF8&qid=1408141753&sr=8-23&keywords=c%2B%2B) by Scott Meyers

As regular consulting material you will probably want to have the following links pre-bookmarked on your browser:

* [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/) I encourage the use of [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) on MacOS

* [OpenFrameworks Forum](http://forum.openframeworks.cc/) 

* [OpenFrameworks IRC Channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openframeworks&uio=MT1mYWxzZSY5PXRydWUmMTE9Mjk39)

* StackOverFlow [C++](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b), [CodeBlocks](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/codeblocks) & [Xcode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xcode) (There is an openFrameworks tag, but is better if you use the OF-forum for questions.)

##### Resources
There are a huge number of papers, books and examples online about algorithms and simulation. Not all of them are in C++, but hopefully you will train yourself to interpret and translate them. Here are some friendly approaches:
